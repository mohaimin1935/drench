## What technologies have I used?
- React JS
- Tailwind CSS

## What did I build?
Drench is a random game I played on the internet. I tried to rebuild the game in react js. I needed some graph algorithms to build this game.

## What have I learned through this project?
- React Hooks
- Depth First Search and its Application
- Graph Representation and Logic

## What are the problems I have solved?
I had to solve the precise logic of the game board. It is basically maintained by graph traversal. So, I had to apply basic theoretical knowledge of graph in the implementation of this game.
